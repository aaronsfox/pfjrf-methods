# Model

This folder contains the generic model used for analysing the raw biomechanical data, and comes from the work of [Rajagopal et al. (2016) and Uhlrich et al. (2022)](https://simtk.org/projects/fbmodpassivecal). If using this model, please cite:

Uhlrich, S.D., Jackson, R.W., Seth, A. Kolesar, J.A., Delp, S.L. Muscle coordination retraining inspired by 
musculoskeletal simulations reduces knee contact force. Sci Rep 12, 9842 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13386-9

The model has been adapted to be lower limb only, which involved: (i) removing the torso and upper limb bodies while adding the mass of these removed bodies to the pelvis; and (ii) adding a marker set that matches the experimental dataset.
